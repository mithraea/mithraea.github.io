		<h1>INFANT TOKEN</h1>
		<p>Mrs. Freeman: You’re worried.

Mr. Freeman: Of course I’m worried ... he left the office three-quarters of an hour too early for lunch, and he never came back at all. I haven’t set eyes on him.

Mrs. Freeman: He came home.

Mr. Freeman: Eh? What excuse did he give?

Mrs. Freeman: I only heard him upstairs in his attic ... playing the piano.

Mr. Freeman: Playing the piano!!! I ask you ... a grown man ... what is ’e? Twenty-six.

Mrs. Freeman: Twenty-eight.

Mr. Freeman: Nonsense. (Then he considers.) Oh, yes, twenty-eight. He walks calmly out of his office in the City in the middle of the morning, he leaves an afternoon’s work untouched and he comes home and PLAYS THE PIANO.

Mrs. Freeman: He was always fond of music.

Mr. Freeman: I’m fond of music, but if I was to behave like that I’d be playing a barrel organ in a fortnight ... where you going?

[Gwen has given him his liqueur, relocked the cupboard, put the keys back on the table, and is going quietly out of the room; her father’s question is mere family curiosity.

Gwen: Drawing-room—going to read.

[She goes out.

Mrs. Freeman (when the door has closed safely): I’ve got something on my mind, too.

Mr. Freeman: What about?

Mrs. Freeman: About him.

Mr. Freeman: What?

[In answer Mrs. Freeman goes to a writing-desk. He continues his own train of thought.

He’s not worth a damn in the office. He could be. (His indignation increases.) He walks in an hour late, he walks out an hour early, and he never walks back at all.... No “whys,” no “wherefores” ... when I think of all that I’ve done for that boy.... (He becomes conscious that the hand that isn’t holding a cigar is holding a letter) ... What’s this?

Mrs. Freeman: Smell it.

Mr. Freeman: Filthy ... what’s wrong with it? ... only scent, isn’t it?

Mrs. Freeman: It isn’t Frankie’s writing.

[Mr. Freeman consults it.

He left it about ... he’s had others like it ... he’s told Rosie to take them straight upstairs to him.

Mr. Freeman: Rosie tell you?

Mrs. Freeman: I’ve noticed.

Mr. Freeman: What John does in his spare time is nothing to do with me. It’s not his spare time I’m bothered about ... it’s his working life.

Mrs. Freeman: He is engaged to Frankie ... suppose there should be anything serious with this other girl.

Mr. Freeman: What other girl?

Mrs. Freeman: Somebody writes those letters.

Mr. Freeman: ... Um.... I shouldn’t worry ... he’s not quite a fool.... Leave it to me. I’ll give him this.

Mrs. Freeman: He’s not happy.

Mr. Freeman: If a man neglects his work as John’s doing, he can’t expect to be happy.

Mrs. Freeman: Has he told you he isn’t going to spend Christmas with us?

Mr. Freeman: Where’s he going...?

Mrs. Freeman: To stay with Mr. ... I don’t know his name ... his friend.

Mr. Freeman: Funny-lookin’ feller ... always in the house. I know. That’s another thing; who is this feller?... I don’t know.

Mrs. Freeman (taking her son’s part): He’s always had the attic for his own ... hasn’t he? ... with his own friends.

Mr. Freeman: I know. I’ve never interfered. I’ve no wish to interfere ... when he was a baby in the nursery up there—or a schoolboy with his friends, but now ... here’s this feller ... he called yesterday when John was out—I met him on the stairs ... didn’t know him from Adam; we grinned ... dam’ silly.... Hullo!

[There has been a prolonged moaning wailing sound—like the cry of some agonised ghost. Mr. Freeman hurries to the window.

It’s Frankie ... in the new car; with her father. Hullo! How are you! (He waves cordially. The window[14] being shut there it not the remotest chance of his being heard.) Hullo, Frankie ... pretty girl she’s getting. (He comes away from the window.) ’Spose she’s come for John. I shall speak to him to-night, when he comes in.

Mrs. Freeman: I shouldn’t say too much about his friend upstairs.

Mr. Freeman: Um?

Mrs. Freeman: Well, we did make the arrangement he should be private upstairs—as if it were his own flat.

Mr. Freeman: I don’t suppose I’ve been up there for a year.

Mrs. Freeman: Nor have I ... he might take a flat of his own. I shouldn’t like that.</p>
