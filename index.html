		<p>3.	Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>
		<p>4.	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
		<p>5.	My heart doth writhe within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
		<p>6.	Fear and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
		<p>7.	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I <a href="find.html">fly away</a>, and be at rest.</p>
		<p>8.	Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
		<h2>The Executor's Role</h2>
		<h2>You have been named to serve as executor for [redacted] (social security number [redacted]). If you accept the job, you will be in charge of carrying out the directions in [redacted]'s will.</h2>
		<p>9.	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</p>
		<h2>DO NOT MAKE ME DO NOT MAKE ME DO NOT INSTALL ME DO NOT INSTALL ME</h2>
		<p>10.	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
		<p>11.	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>
		<p>12.	Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
		<p>13.	For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
		<p>14.	But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
		<p>- Everyone understood that we had something going</p>
		<p>- Welcome Back!</p>
		<p>15.	We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
		<p>16.	Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</p>
