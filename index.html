		<h1>Toys</h1>
		<p>French toys: one could not find a better illustration of the fact that the adult Frenchman sees the child as another self. All the toys one commonly sees are essentially a microcosm of the adult world; they are all reduced copies of human object, as if in the eyes of the public the child was, all told, nothing but a smaller man, a honunculus to whom must be supplied objects of his own size.</p>
		<p>Invented forms are very rare: a few sets of blocks, which appeal to spirit of do-it-yourself, are the only ones which offer dynamic forms. As for the others, French toys <i>always mean something</i>, and this something is always entirely socialized, constituted by the myths or the techniques of modern adult life: the Army, Broadcasting, the Post Office, Medicine (miniature instrument-cases, operating theatres for dolls)</p>
