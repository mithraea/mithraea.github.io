		<p>3.	Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>
		<p>4.	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
		<p>5.	My heart doth writhe within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
		<p>6.	Fear and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
		<p>7.	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I <a href="find.html">fly away</a>, and be at rest.</p>
		<p>8.	Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
		<h2>The Executor's Role</h2>
		<h2>You have been named to serve as executor for [redacted] (social security number [redacted]). If you accept the job, you will be in charge of carrying out the directions in [redacted]'s will.</h2>
		<p>9.	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</p>
		<h2>DO NOT MAKE ME DO NOT MAKE ME DO NOT INSTALL ME DO NOT INSTALL ME</h2>
		<p>10.	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
		<p>11.	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>
		<p>12.	Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
		<p>13.	For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
		<p>14.	But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
		<p>- Everyone understood that we had something going</p>
		<p>- Welcome Back!</p>
		<p>15.	We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
		<p>16.	Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</p>

		<p>There was a time I considered all these things with care and attention towards a culmination. This end was to be deferred many times, each shift of the end changed it to better fit with my notion of The Possible. I became more pragmatic, but this pragmatism was itself a form of idealization.</p>
		<p>I think everyone has some narrations that appeal to them from a young age. These narrations are formed from a network of others, synthesized in dreams and daydreams and yearnings and projections. Not all narrations have the same magnetism for each person but there are pools into which we can delve and find ourselves among others who delve with us.</p>

		<p>Under no circumstances are my whereabouts to be disclosed, I am not far away. I will not let you know when I get There. If you need to reach me don't hesitate to forget about it.</p>
		<p>I am underneath the tablecloth, you cannot see me. I am not within reach. I hope you understand where I am not. I hope you understand my whereabouts are indetermined.</p>
		<p>I am on top of the tablecloth, you cannot see me. I am not within reach. Please don't ask about me. I cannot be recovered from where you are. Please don't ask about this again.</p>
